## 📌 Intro  
An **Interactive Scoreboard** web app that allows users to track, update, and display team scores in real-time.  
It’s designed for events, competitions, or classroom activities where quick and clear visualization of results is needed.  

---

## ⚡ Tech Stack  
- **HTML5** – structure  
- **CSS3** – styling and layout  
- **JavaScript (Vanilla JS)** – logic and interactivity  

---

## ✨ Features  
✔️ Add multiple teams to the scoreboard  
✔️ Update scores dynamically with simple controls  
✔️ Display **Top 3 teams** separately for easy visibility  
✔️ Full team list shown below the winners’ section  
✔️ Automatically hides teams with **zero points** from the Top 3 section  
✔️ Grid-based bottom section so all teams fit on one screen without scrolling  
✔️ Responsive and clean UI for web display

## 🛠 Process  
This project started as a simple static scoreboard but evolved into a dynamic **interactive dashboard**.  
Initially, score updates were manual, but JavaScript was used to automate sorting, ranking, and highlighting the top three.  

**Challenges faced:**  
- Keeping all teams visible in one window  
- Excluding zero-score teams from winners’ section  
- Making the UI responsive for different screen sizes  

Through several iterations, the final product became more user-friendly and visually appealing.

## 📚 Learnings  
- Improved **JavaScript DOM manipulation** skills  
- Learned how to dynamically **sort and display data** in real-time  
- Understood the importance of **UI/UX design** in dashboards  
- Gained experience building a **responsive interface** without frameworks

## 🚀 Improvement Ideas  
🔹 Add persistence (save scores locally or to a database)  
🔹 Provide admin controls (reset, export results, undo)  
🔹 Dark mode / customizable themes  
🔹 Better mobile support (large buttons, optimized layout)  
🔹 API integration for live sports/event feeds
